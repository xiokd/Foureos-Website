                <p>Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you! I am John Oreo, founder of Oreo itself.
                    I assume you have come here to learn
                    more about what makes this wonderful brain tick. Well,
                    look no further as I grant you the amazing knowledge of my
                    youth! I hope you've set aside some cookies and milk, because I have quite
                the story to share with you! Of course, the best way to understand the why and how I do things,
                    is to go all the way back to the beginning. Thus, I present to you, the backstory of the greatest cookie
                    connoisseur of all time!</p>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>

                <p>It all started back in the year 1895 in Oklahoma City, New York, I was a young boy who
                lived in a one-bedroom silo, as the farmhouse associated with it
                was rented out to others in order for my family to make ends meet.
                I knew that I had to find a way to not only elevate my life, but
                to evolve the standard of living as humanity knew it. I knew what
                must be done, I must do something extraordinary, something revolutionary,
                something...confectionary! My inspiration for the creme-filled cookie of goodness
                came to me while I was munching on my curdled milk with my grandma's secret charcoal
                graham cracker recipe. It was a single rock in my path that would change the course of my life forever.
                <br>
                <br>
                    It tripped me! I was walking and this rock moved under my foot and caused me to drop my snack to
                    the ground! I wouldn't let a precious resource go to waste like that, my family would be furious I let
                    premium milk go to waste in the dirt! Taking great care, as the cookies were so burnt they barely held together,
                    I expertly scraped up the milk onto the brittle biscuits and took a bite. It was incredible! The burnt flavor mixed with
                    the creamy, albeit chunky milk was an amazing combination. That's when I knew, I had to stake my claim in this world. I would not
                    simply stand aside and live my life in a silo. I would go forth and use my name and creation to better the world.

                <h1>The Miracle</h1>

                <p>As the years went by, I had spent my life honing this new-found skill. Brittle cookies sandwiched between
                soft chewy goodness, who would have guessed it?! But curdled milk and burnt biscuit just wasn't landing as well as I had
                hoped. It seemed that no matter who I offered it to, it was met with harsh, simply incorrect criticism.
                I just knew there was the secret to fame and fortune within my work, and I toiled away tirelessly
                to make my dream a reality. It wasn't until I managed to rent out the farmhouse's kitchen that I could really
                tap into my creative genius.<br><br>

                It was February 30th, 1912 when I finally hit the jackpot. I could've sworn that this next creation would
                have been another failure, I had completely underbaked the biscuit, and the new creme I was experimenting with
                was far too soft and sweet for my tastes. Nonetheless, my family had suggested I try this flavor combination after
                sampling something called an Oh-Ray-Oh. It was a success! Instead of grimaces and
                forced manners, everyone had actually seemed to be enjoying the cookies! I was overjoyed, even sampling a few more myself
                in celebration. I didn't even remember writing my last name on the biscuits, but I loved my craftsmanship and would continue! </p>

                <h2>The Disaster</h2>
                <p>Despite my glorious creation, I should have known that someone would've come to steal my idea.
                upon arriving at my local farmer's market, I was only able to sell my cookies for mere moments before being
                stopped by men in black and white suits, a familiar cookie emblazoned on their jacket, offsetting the
                dark fabric. They informed me that if I did not cease selling "their" product I would be thrown into a cookie
                conundrum!<br><br>

                Needless to say, they didn't take well to my reaction, which I do not feel necessary nor appropriate to describe. After the
                funeral, and selling of the beloved family silo, I once again started from the bottom and have been working my way back up
                to the top. How have I lived for over 127 years and not look a day over 25? It's simple, the desire for success and amazing flavors
                has allowed me to consider age a simple value of experience. My creations will once again reclaim the top spot of cookie sandwich industry!</p>
