                <h2>Early Life</h2>

                <p>Back in Oklahoma City, New York, I was a young boy who
                lived in a one-bedroom silo, as the farmhouse associated with it
                was rented out to others in order for my family to make ends meet.
                I knew that I had to find a way to not only elevate my life, but
                to evolve the standard of living as humanity knew it. I knew what
                must be done, I must do something extraordinary, something revolutionary,
                something...confectionary!</p>
